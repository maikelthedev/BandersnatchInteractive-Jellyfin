# BandersnatchInteractive - Jellyfin Plugin

An interactive video player plugin for Jellyfin that enables choice-based navigation and branching storylines for Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.

> **Forked from**: [mehotkhan/BandersnatchInteractive](https://github.com/mehotkhan/BandersnatchInteractive)  
> This repository extends the original standalone HTML5 player to work as a native Jellyfin plugin.

## ✨ Features

- �� **Full Interactive Playbook**: Complete choice-based navigation with branching storylines
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Controls**: All original controls plus new speed control features
- 📺 **Jellyfin Integration**: Native plugin that streams directly from your Jellyfin server
- 🎯 **Choice Management**: Visual choice overlays with countdown timers
- 📝 **Subtitle Support**: Integrated English subtitles with toggle functionality
- 🎮 **Speed Control**: Stepped playbook speed (0.25x to 4x) with instant reset
- 💾 **State Persistence**: Remembers your choices and progress across sessions
- 🏪 **Plugin Repository**: Easy installation via Jellyfin's plugin repository system

## Build notes (this fork)

Upstream was written against Jellyfin 10.8 and only ever shipped a five-choice stub
of the interactive manifest, so on a current server it could not branch the story.
This fork was rebuilt and reworked against a live **Jellyfin 12.1**:

* **Real branching.** `Web/bandersnatch.js` + `Web/SegmentMap.js` carry the full
  interactive manifest (250 segments, 174 choice moments, 241 preconditions, 111
  segment groups) and `Web/interactive-player.js` implements the engine: segment
  transitions, moments, preconditions, segment groups, breadcrumbs, persistent
  state, and the deferred-vs-immediate choice semantics of the original player.
* **Streams from Jellyfin.** The player asks the API for the item's MediaSources,
  scores them (H.264/MP4 first, HEVC last) and plays
  `/Videos/{id}/stream?static=true`, so the browser gets a rendition it can decode.
* **ABI.** The project targets `net10.0`. Built on a machine that runs Jellyfin it
  references that server's own assemblies (`build.sh` discovers them); otherwise
  (CI, plain `dotnet build`) it restores the `Jellyfin.Controller` /
  `Jellyfin.Model` 12.1.0 packages.
* **The video must be the 5:12:14 "all endings" master** whose timeline matches the
  segment map. A 10-bit HEVC release will not play in Chromium on Linux (no
  software HEVC decoder, and no VA-API driver on many desktops), so keep an H.264
  rendition in the library — the player picks it automatically when both exist.
* `jellyfin-plugin/test-engine.js` (node) walks the whole story graph against the
  real data and asserts every automatic transition is a legal successor.

Player URL: `/InteractiveVideo/Player/{ItemId}`, with deep links
`#<segmentId>`, `#<segmentId>/<momentIndex>` and `#t<seconds>`.

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/deathrjj/BandersnatchInteractive-Jellyfin/releases)
2. Extract the plugin files
3. Copy to your Jellyfin plugins directory:
   - **Linux**: `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/InteractiveVideo/`
   - **macOS**: `~/.local/share/jellyfin/plugins/InteractiveVideo/`
   - **Windows**: `%PROGRAMDATA%\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\InteractiveVideo\`
4. Restart Jellyfin server
5. Navigate to: `https://your-jellyfin-server/InteractiveVideo/Player/{ItemId}`

### Option 3: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deathrjj/BandersnatchInteractive-Jellyfin.git
   cd BandersnatchInteractive-Jellyfin
   ```

2. **Install .NET SDK** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS (via Homebrew)
   brew install dotnet

   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-6.0

   # Windows - Download from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
   ```

3. **Build the plugin**:
   ```bash
   cd jellyfin-plugin
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

4. **Install the built plugin**:
   ```bash
   # The build script creates a 'plugin' folder in the root directory
   # Copy its contents to your Jellyfin plugins directory
   cp -r ../plugin/* /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/InteractiveVideo/
   ```

5. **Restart Jellyfin server**

## 📖 Usage

### Finding Your Item ID

1. Open Jellyfin web interface
2. Navigate to your Bandersnatch video
3. Look at the URL: `/web/index.html#!/details?id={ItemId}`
4. Copy the Item ID from the URL

### Accessing the Interactive Player

Navigate to: `https://your-jellyfin-server/InteractiveVideo/Player/{ItemId}`

Replace `{ItemId}` with your Bandersnatch video's Item ID.

### First Time Setup

1. The video will load automatically from Jellyfin
2. Click the play button when prompted (browser autoplay policy)
3. Use keyboard controls to navigate
4. Press `S` to toggle English subtitles
5. Enjoy the interactive experience!

## 🎯 How It Works

The plugin integrates with Jellyfin's streaming infrastructure while adding interactive capabilities:

- **Video Streaming**: Uses Jellyfin's native video streaming (`/Videos/{itemId}/stream`)
- **Interactive Metadata**: Embedded JSON defines choice points and branching logic
- **Choice Detection**: Monitors video timeline for predefined decision moments
- **Segment Jumping**: Seamlessly transitions between different story paths
- **State Management**: Tracks user choices and viewing progress
